            Conveying the HTTP status code; this is so that all information is
            in one place, but also to correct for changes in the status code due
            to the usage of proxy servers. The status member, if present, is
            only advisory as generators MUST use the same status code in the
            actual HTTP response to assure that generic HTTP software that does
            not understand this format still behaves correctly
